Highlights     Central Missouri Math Educators club member Missouri Council of Teachers of Mathematics 2014 Conference   Tutoring experience MS Office proficient Organized  Timely       Accomplishments   While working for Beauty Brands I received two awards. I received the Award of Excellence and Shift Manager of the Year. The Award of Excellence is a company wide award and is awarded to one person from each district. Out of seven locations I was chosen for my district. I was presented the award at Beauty Brands annual banquet in Kansas City. I accepted the award from the founder and CEO and was recognized in front of all of home office, location managers, and other award winners. The next year I was awarded with Shift Manager of the Year for my district.     Experience   I have a little over 100 hours of observation and participation field experience. Sixty hours of my field experience are observations from algebra I at Lees Summit High School summer school and 6th grade math and social studies at Brittany Hill. Fifteen hours were spent at Holden Middle School tutoring 6th through 8th graders in various contents. I spent twelve hours observing special education students in both a general education and special education classrooms. I finished about twenty hours in a 6th grade math class at Grain Valley South Middle School. One of my peers and I taught three different lessons and led several small groups in discussions about various math articles. One lesson we taught was reviewing order of operations. Since the students were newly familiar with the information we wanted them to get some practice working on various problems using multiple operations. We played “I have, who has?” As each student read their equation to the class I would write it on the board so that they could visualize it and write it down. Students would call out the answer when it was their card and then we solved the problem on the board as a class before we moved on to the next card. The students really enjoyed this because it was something that we did all together and they saw it as more of a game and thought it was fun.

Together, the GATE identified students and I, created a school newspaper. We named it the Jr Journal and invented five topics that would be in every issue. I helped create an outline and template that our reporters could follow and eventually do independently. Each student chose a different topic every month and would either interview or research to write an article for that section. They would then write a rough draft, that I would edit, and then they would type the final draft and put it into the newspaper template. Students would also have a chance to find graphics or take pictures that fit their topic. It turned out great and we were able to publish four issues. This will be our second year. This was a great accomplishment for me as an educator, because I love to write and was in my school newspaper in High School. I had the chance to share a passion of mine and see students enjoy coming in after school and put their advanced brains to work. It was such a great experience and can't wait to have that again this year.\n\nJob offer:\nWe are seeking an individual with native English\r\nlanguage skills who will teach a mixed-age classroom at the elementary\r\nlevel in all subject areas using English as the primary language of\r\ninstruction.

Here's how to choose a letter font that is professional and readable, as well as how to choose the appropriate font size for your letter. It is important to select a font that is large enough so that the reader doesn't have to squint to read your letter, but not so big that your letter doesn't fit well on a page. Use a Basic Font Using a simple font will ensure that your letter is easy to read. Basic fonts like Arial, Verdana, and Times New Roman work well. Depending on how much content you have in your letter select a 10 or 12 point font size. It's best if you can format your letter so it fits on one page. Regardless of the font size you select, there needs to be space at the top of the letter and between each paragraph and each section of your cover letter. Here's how to space your cover letter. When you are using Microsoft Word, here is how to select a font for your letter and how to select the font size. If you're using a different word processing program, the process is similar. Select the content of your cover letter then choose a font and a font size. You may need to try a couple of different sizes to make sure that your cover letter fits on a single page. How to Select a Cover Letter Font Select a font from the list at the top of your document before you start writing your letter, or: Type your cover letter. Highlight the content of your letter. Either select the font from the pop-up window or select the font from the list at the top of the document.    Experience   Production Associate  03/2006  to  Current   Company Name  City ,  State    cover letter typically accompanies each resume you send out. Your cover letter may make the difference between obtaining a job interview or having your resume ignored, so it makes good sense to devote the necessary time and effort to writing effective cover letters. A cover letter should complement, not duplicate, your resume. Its purpose is to interpret the data-oriented, factual resume and add a personal touch. A cover letter is often your earliest written contact with a potential employer, creating a critical first impression. Find out more of the differences between a resume and a cover letter. There are three general types of cover letters: The application letter which responds to a known job opening (review samples) The prospecting letter which inquires about possible positions (review samples) The networking letter which requests information and assistance in your job search (review samples) Your cover letter should be designed specifically for each purpose outlined above as well as for each position you seek. Do not design a form letter and send it to every potential employer (you know what you do with junk mail!). Effective cover letters explain the reasons for your interest in the specific organization and identify your most relevant skills or experiences (remember, relevance is determined by the employer's self-interest). The letter should express a high level of interest and knowledge about the position. Keep in mind that your cover letter doesn't need to be long - a page is plenty. Here's information on how long a cover letter should be.

Apart from SharePoint 2010, we used SQL Server 2012 and ASP.Net to develop this application. 4) eRFA (electronic Request For Agreement): RFA is an agreement between two parties (Company and Client) before they start the work. This process involved more than eight approvers to approve the agreement. The existing process which involves manual submission has many problems such as knowing status of agreement, percentage of completion and approval status etc. The new eRFA application is developed in SharePoint as an electronic application which has more flexible UI to capture all required data and it eliminated most of the manual efforts in terms of searching for online results and internal applications to validate the data entered by requester, more flexible approval process and status tracking. 5) Export Logging Tool Export Logging Tool is a web based application to collect and log all export activities occurring at Pratt & Whitney Military Engines with a simple interface with an ability to generate various reports required to report of export events. Apart from these features it also includes the facility of uploading bulk data into the database which needs to be validated for the correctness of the data against business rules which determine the type of data that can be uploaded into each column.
